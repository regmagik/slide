# Encrypt or Compress First?
This question was asked in the interview: 

>If you need to compress and encrypt data, do you encrypt then compress or compress then encrypt?

<Steps>

- The answer used to be *Compress First then Encrypt*, because compression is not effective on encrypted data.
- However, around 2012 researchers found a way to break encryption in some scenarios involving compression of HTTPS traffic
- See [CRIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME) and [BREACH](https://github.com/nealharris/BREACH) attacks
- It's more secure to just Encrypt, and DO NOT Compress
