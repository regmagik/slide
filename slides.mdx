# Encrypt or Compress First?
This question was asked in the interview: 

If you need to compress and encrypt data, do you encrypt then compress or compress then encrypt?

<Steps>

- *Compress first then encrypt* is better for *compression and performance*
- Compression of encrypted data is much less effective
- However, *compress first* has a potential *security weakness*

# Security Weakness
One can break encryption of compressed HTTPS traffic in some cases.

- It's more secure to just encrypt, and not compress
- See [CRIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME) and [BREACH](https://github.com/nealharris/BREACH) attacks for details
